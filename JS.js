                <h2>What is Javascript?</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is the programming language of HTML and the Web.  It's often abbreviated as "JS", It's a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted run-time language. It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification.</p>
                <h2>A simple "Display Date & Time"</h2>
                    <button type="button"
                    onclick="document.getElementById('time').innerHTML = Date()">
                    Click me to display Date and Time.</button>

                    <p id="time"></p>

                    <li>
                        <b>do/while </b>
                        " - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true"
